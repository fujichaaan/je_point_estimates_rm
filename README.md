## 1. Motivation üå±
The relative measures (e.g. odds ratio and hazard ratio) are one of the most reported indices in statistical analysis for epidemiology. However, there are many incautious graphic presentation for these indices in both scientific papers and dissemination to the public.
This letter is inspired by the previous correspondence by Hosseinpoor AR in <i>Lancet</i>

<br>

## 2. Purpose üïµÔ∏è
There are two main purposes in this letter:
- To provide what is not good in conventional graphic presentation in relative measures for association
- To provide how to improve such incautious figures

<br>

## 3. Key messages üîë  R code is <a href="https://github.com/fujichaaan/je_point_estimates_rm/blob/main/code_figures.R">here</a>
To show the point estimates for relative measures in association, there are three main key points to be considered as follows:

### 1. Starting from 1 (A vs. B)
In panel A (starting from 0), OR=2.0 seems to be four times bigger than OR=0.5, while panel B shows each bar graph start from 1.
It is much better than the the 0-starting bar chars, but panel B is still problematic...

<br>

### 2. Use logarithmic scale (B vs. C)
In panel B, OR=2.0 seems to be twice bigger than OR=0.5, but panel C improve the magnitude of effect size.
Therefore, although it can make fair comparison for OR=2.0 and OR=0.5 (different direction), it is unclear for statistical significance yet.

<br>

### 3. Use point + error bars (C vs. D)
In panel C, we can make fair comparison of effect sizes, however, it remains unclear whether error bar crosses 0 or not.
To improve this defect, the panel D shows better data visualization for relative measures to clearly shows confidential intervals.
